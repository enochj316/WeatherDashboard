# Weather Dashboard

This was an assignment to create a weather forecasting website using CSS, Java, HTML and the API function. I wrote this using VSC (Visual Studio Code).

## Objective 

The object was to use an API to retrive weather data and covert it into a user friendly view. The goal was to provide a one stop site where users can search for the weather for any city around the world and also give the user the ability to store previous searches in their local stoarge.
